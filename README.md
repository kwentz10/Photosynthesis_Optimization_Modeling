# Photosynthesis_Optimization_Modeling

This repository contains model code that I am using to understand plant optimization strategiesâ€”that is, water use efficiency (WUE) and nutrient use efficiency (NUE). 

The most updated photosynthesis model that I am using is in the file: Photosynthesis_Model.py

I use combinations of leaf traits in the photosynthesis model to determine WUE and NUE. This can be found in the file: leaf_parameter_inputs.py

I plot WUE and NUE using the file: Trait_Based Photo_Model_InterSpecificVariation.py
