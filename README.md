# Photosynthesis_Optimization_Modeling
This repository contains model code that I am using to understand plant optimization strategies. 
The Trait_Based_Photo_Model.py code describes the preliminary photosynthesis+stomatal conductance model.
The Trait_Based_Photo_Model_Sensitivity_Analysis.py code performs a sensitivity analysis. It includes model iterations where different model parameters are perturbed. 
The leaf_parameter_inputs.py code will be used if I need to do a sensitivity analysis of combinations of model parameter perturbations.
